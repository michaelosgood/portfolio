      <p> 
        My name is Michael Osgood and I am a huge science and tech enthusiast. 
        I completed an intensive 24-week Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp through the University of California, Irvine
        and I currently work as a Quality Assurance Tester for PrescribeWellness, an innovative software company in Irvine, California.
        In my tenure, I have gained comprehensive knowledge in developing dynamic web applications and quality assurance testing.
        I have obtained experience with many popular technologies including: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, GitHub,
        React.js, MySQL and many other tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        From 2007 - 2011, I worked in Public Health for the U.S Air Force. As a Public Health Tech, my overall responsibility
        was to protect the local population from environmental threats through preventative measures. 
        Working in Public Health spurred my fascination with Biology and Preventative Medicine.
        So I moved to Boulder, Colorado and studied Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Colorado. 
        During that time, I studied a myriad of topics to include Evolution, Genetics, Ecology, Chemistry, and Physics. 
        Also,I was first introducted to tech companies. I started working in Client Support as a Support Analyst for VisionLink, 
        a software company in Boulder, Colorado. After completion of my bachelors degree, I moved to California and started working 
        for PrescribeWellness, also on the client-side of software. After 2 years, I transitioned into my current role as a Quality Assurance Tester. 
        In this role, I have become extremely knowledgeable with cross-browser testing, creating test cases, developing test plans, 
        debugging browser-related issues, documenting detailed results of tests, and collaborating with developers on resolving bugs.
