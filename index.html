      <img src="assets/images/profile.JPG" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">
      <p> 
        My name is Michael Osgood and I am a huge science and tech enthusiast. 
        I am a full-stack web developer. 
        Currently, I am enrolled in a full-stack coding program through the University of California Irvine. 
        I also work as a User Acceptance Tester for a cloud-based software company in Irvine, California.
      </p>
      <p>
        To elaborate on my background, I worked in Public Health for the U.S Air Force. 
        I was stationed at an air base in New Jersey in where I helped protect the local population from environmental threats through preventative measures. 
        This career field spurred my fascination with biology. 
      </p>
      <p>
        After four years in the Air Force, I studied Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Colorado in Boulder. 
        During that time, I studied a myriad of topics to include evolution, genetics, ecology, chemistry, and physics. 
      </p>
      <p>
        During college, I started working for a software company in Colorado as a support analyst. 
        After graduation, I moved to California and resumed working on the client-facing side of software for a pharmaceutical software company.
        After 3 years working on the client-facing side of software, I have become a User Acceptance Tester. 
        I work with developers to test and trouble-shoot the software before it goes to production. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In my tenure, I have gained valuable experience from assisting clients on the client-facing side to collaborating with the development team to resolve bugs on the development side. Not only that, I understand how frustrating using poorly-designed software can affect the end-user. 
        This knowledge I accumulated working with software is going to help me become a better developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, I am gaining crucial knowledge in the development and testing of software through the full-stack coding boot camp. 
        The coursework covers many topics from HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, React.js, MySQL and many other tools that will help me become a full-stack developer. 
        The experience I have obtained working for tech companies coupled with the knowledge I am acquiring through coding boot camp will help me tremendously as I embark on this path to become a developer.
      </p>
